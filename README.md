The Winter is Coming Ethereum Miner is another Ethereum Miner optimized to work on
Server type Intel/AMD x86_64 based servers under any modern Linux.

We made it so it can be effectively used even on older Servers many of which
are not used any longer.   These include the millions of old Xeon E5-26XX CPU
servers.

To use the files provided here git **All** the files in main
repository to a directory on your server.  

Modify the `mp` file putting in your Public Ethereum address.

Then start the WIC Miner detached by typing `startwic`.

It will take about 30 minutes to generate the required DAG and then the WIC
Miner will mine Ethereum.   

It will output status every two hours this can be checked by running `wicstat`.

More complete instructions on usage are available on our site
[WIC Miner Usage](http://www.aquilasys.com/wicminer.html).

We also have easy to follow instructions to use
